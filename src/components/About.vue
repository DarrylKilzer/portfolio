        <h3>Every Position I have held, be it professional or personal, I have worked diligently to motivate and inspire those around me to be the best version of themselves they can be. This has always been a principal I have dedicated a tremendous amount of time and effort to for no reason other than my own personal beliefs. I truly enjoy watching others grow. It is one of the most rewarding experiences any person can be a part of, no matter how small a role played.</h3>

        <h3>I am a tinkering person by nature. As such I have worked in a wide variety of fields to a proficient level. Initially I had a small business building custom PCs and repairing them as a young teenager. As a young adult I enjoyed a time in Logging and the Lumber industry. I became proficient in many jobs there. There were so many wonderful machines to learn about! I moved on to work within the food preparation industry where I again wore many hats. Next I joined the retail industry where I became an inventory specialist and leader. I enjoyed the last part greatly as it allowed me to have a lot of influence in developing my teammates. Again I turned my sights to a side hobby I enjoy, woodworking. I became a subcontractor in finish carpentry mostly for new homes. I was fortunate to work along side other ambitious individuals and really enjoyed the rewards of the excellent hard work we accomplished. Throughout all of this was an underlying hobby and passion that surfaced professionally on several ocassions. Game development in the form of table tops, RPGs, video games, anything that grabbed my interest. The challenges and problems were so much fun to resolve, and all the uniqueness of each component naturally fed my tinkering side. So, I propelled myself headfirst into the professional software engineering world expanding upon my natural hardware and software base.</h3>
